It's intimidating at first, but once you know a few basic commands, it becomes pretty friendly, pretty quickly. Like your mom used to say when you were trying food for the first time, "Try it, you'll love it!"</p><p>Note: these directions are specifically for Mac OSX users.</p><ol><li><p>Open the "Terminal" app.</p><p>Notice what it says in there â€“ that will tell you "where" you currently are in the computer. You should be in your top-level user folder (for me, that looks like <span class=code>Stephen-Nixon:~ stephennixon$</span>).</p></li><li><p>Next, let's make a new folder. Input:</p><p class=code>mkdir your-folder-name</p><p>This will create a folder. Keep in mind, it's best to make folders that are all lowercase and have no spaces.</p></li><li><p>Let's find out what folders are in your current location, and check if your new folder is in there. Type in:</p><p class=code>ls</p><p><em>(And press enter/return to input the command).</em></p><p>This will tell you all the files that exist in whatever directory you're currently in ("directory" is just a fancy term for "folder").</p></li><li><p>Next, let's navigate to a folder. Say you want to go from where you are into a folder called "websites." You would input:</p><p class=code>cd websites</p><p>The "cd" stands for "Change Directory." Want to go back up a folder? Try:</p><p class=code>cd ..</p><p>The double periods signify "go up a level." If you'd like to go up multiple levels, you can simply use <span class=code>..</span> for each level you want to navigate. So, if you want to navigate up two levels, that looks like:</p><p class=code>cd ../..</p></li><li><p class=code>mkdir your-site-name</p><p>This will create a folder</p></li><li><p>content</p></li></ol></div></section><section><h1>Git Basics</h1><!--toggle open / closed--><input id=toggle type=checkbox> <label for=toggle></label><!--toggle open / closed--><div class=section-content><p>The command line allows you to do some awesome things with computers and the internet.

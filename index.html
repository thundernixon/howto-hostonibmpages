 		<h1>Command Line Basics</h1>
    <p>
      Let's start with some basics of the command line.
    </p>
    <p>The command line allows you to do some awesome things with computers and the internet. It's intimidating at first, but once you know a few basic commands, it becomes pretty friendly, pretty quickly. Like your mom used to say when you were trying food for the first time, "Try it, you'll love it!"</p>
    <p>Note: these directions are specifically for Mac OSX users.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Open the "Terminal" app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice what it says in there â€“ that will tell you "where" you currently are in the computer. You should be in your top-level user folder (for me, that looks like <span class="code">Stephen-Nixon:~  stephennixon$</span>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Next, let's make a new folder. Input:
        </p>
 				<p class="code">
 					mkdir your-folder-name
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					This will create a folder. Keep in mind, it's best to make folders that are all lowercase and have no spaces.
 				</p>
 			</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let's find out what folders are in your current location, and check if your new folder is in there. Type in:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          ls
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>(And press enter/return to input the command).</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This will tell you all the files that exist in whatever directory you're currently in ("directory" is just a fancy term for "folder").
        </p>
      </li>
 		 	<li>
        <p>
          Next, let's navigate to a folder. Say you want to go from where you are into a folder called "websites." You would input:
        </p>
 				<p class="code">
 					cd websites
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					The "cd" stands for "Change Directory." Want to go back up a folder? Try:
 				</p>
 				<p class="code">
 					cd ..
 				</p>
        <p>
          The double periods signify "go up a level." If you'd like to go up multiple levels, you can simply use <span class="code">..</span> for each level you want to navigate. So, if you want to navigate up two levels, that looks like:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          cd ../..
        </p>
 			</li>

 			<li>
 				<p class="code">
 					mkdir your-site-name
 				</p>
 				<p>
 					This will create a folder
 				</p>
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<p>
            content
 				</p>
 			</li>
 		</ol>
